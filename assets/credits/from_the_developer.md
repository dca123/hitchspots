Hey !

Thanks for using HitchSpots ! I started this project since the hitchwiki maps isn't working anymore. It really helped me out while I was hitchhiking. Luckily, I was able to find a bunch of the old locations from the old hitchwiki maps and I figured why not make it more accessible to everyone else. So here we are. 

Offline functionality is part of the plan but since it requires a different tech stack just for offline usage, it will take some time to build it. 

Good luck on the road,
